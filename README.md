## **PZMA** - ***The easiest way to make Project Zomboid mods.***

PZMA is a passion project, for sure. But it has great promise, and could revolutionize the way
mods are made, managed, and updated for Project Zomboid.

I (DeanRexx) started making mods for Project Zomboid, but found that it was extremely tedious and
time consuming. So I thought to myself, "I wonder if there are any IDEs for making mods in Project Zomboid?"

No. No there is not, obviously... So why not make it myself :D<br>
<br>
<br>

# Latest Release
**Release:** PZMA v0.0.1

**Download:**  
    [Click Here](https://github.com/deanrexx/PZMA/blob/7fd196b3c80f68380080a2f5d09585fa1c3b4462/Versions/version-0-0-1.zip)

**Notes:**  
* Fixed issue with program not running.
* Bare-bones. No development features.
<br>
<br>

# Current Features

* Incredible design - in my opinion atleast
* Nothing else. Unless you count the 3 hours it took me to figure out how to make a custom title bar and scrap the crappy Windows one.
<br>

# Planned Features

* **Built-in Text Editor:** Full, rich support for Lua and JavaScript/JSON, including highlighting, and proper indentation.<br><br>
* **Built-in Explorer:** Manage all of the files included with the mod you are working on.<br><br>
* **Multi-Script Management:** Allows you to quickly switch between scripts, similar to Notepad++.<br><br>
* **Built-in Texture Creator:** Create game-accurate, correct pixel ratio textures, decals, and icons.<br><br>
  * Allows for quick and easy designing of new objects for your mods. Will also allow you to quickly copy the texture of any vanilla item and modify it to your liking.<br><br>
* **Automated Folder Structuring:** When compiling your mod, or creating new files, the required and appropriate folders will be created and the new files will be stored according to the vanilla game's filing structure.<br><br>
  * This means you no longer have to painstakingly move files around until the mod decides to work :)<br><br>
* **Automated Workshop Compilation:** Essentially, you click a button and the program will compile the mod ready to be published.<br><br>
  * Creates all of the necessary files to do so (workshop.txt, [mod.info](https://mod.info), etc.)
  * You will also be able to upload your thumbnail, poster and icon images at this stage and they will be automatically sorted for you.
  * Once you have uploaded your images, the workshop.txt and [mod.info](https://mod.info) files will be updated accordingly to include them.<br><br>
* **Easy-to-Use Template System:** PZMA will feature a "Template" system, similar to Unity's asset store.<br><br>
  * From the "Media" tab, you will be able to easily duplicate any of the vanilla game's existing scripts and textures and change them however you like.
  * I will be re-writing most of the important scripts myself to create easy-to-use templates for hundreds of different in-game features and systems that you can modify freely.
  * All templates will be well-documented in the form of comments, even if you are in-experienced with programming you should still be able to change a thing or two.

### **You.**<br><br>

All of you :)

Just knowing that even one person thinks what I'm trying to create is worth-while gives me the motivation to keep creating.<br>
Thank you, and I hope we can make something beautiful together.
