# Project Zomboid Modder's Assistant

## (PZMA) - The easiest way to make Project Zomboid mods.

PZMA is a passion project, for sure. But it has great promise, and could revolutionize the way
mods are made, managed, and updated for Project Zomboid.

I (DeanRexx) started making mods for Project Zomboid, but found that it was extremely tedious and
time consuming. So I thought to myself, "I wonder if there are any IDEs for making mods in Project Zomboid?"

No. No there is not, obviously... So why not make it myself :D

# Current Features

* Incredible design
* Nothing else. Unless you count the 3 hours it took me to figure out how to make a custom title bar and scrap the crappy Windows one.
