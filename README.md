# Project Zomboid Modder's Assistant

## (PZMA) - The easiest way to make Project Zomboid mods.

PZMA is a passion project, for sure. But it has great promise, and could revolutionize the way
mods are made, managed, and updated for Project Zomboid.

I (DeanRexx) started making mods for Project Zomboid, but found that it was extremely tedious and
time consuming. So I thought to myself, "I wonder if there are any IDEs for making mods in Project Zomboid?"

No. No there is not, obviously... So why not make it myself :D

# Latest Version

# Current Features

* Incredible design
* Nothing else. Unless you count the 3 hours it took me to figure out how to make a custom title bar and scrap the crappy Windows one.

# Planned Features

* Fully-functional built-in text editor with full, rich support for Lua, including highlighting, and proper indentation.
* Built-in explorer to manage all of the files included with the mod you are working on.
* Multi-script management, allowing you to quickly switch between scripts, similar to Notepad++.
* Fully-functional built-in texture/decal/icon creator, including game-accurate pixel ratio for each type of 2D design. Allows for quick and easy designing of new objects for your mods. Will also allow you to quickly copy the texture of any vanilla item and modify it to your liking.
* Automated folder structuring. When compiling your mod, or creating new files, the required and appropriate folders will be created and the new files will be stored correctly. This means you no longer have to painstakingly move files around until the mod decides to work :)
* Automated Compilation for Uploading to the Workshop. Essentially, you click a button to tell the program you want to compile the mod ready to be published, and the program creates all of the necessary files to do so (workshop.txt, [mod.info](https://mod.info), etc.) You will also be able to upload your thumbnail, poster and icon images at this stage and they will be automatically sorted for you. Once you have uploaded your images, the workshop.txt and [mod.info](https://mod.info) files will be updated accordingly to include them.
* Easy-to-use template system. PZMA will feature a "Media" system, similar to Unity's asset store, only for Project Zomboid, and only the vanilla content. From the "Media" tab, you will be able to easily copy any of the vanilla game's existing scripts and textures and change them however you like. The cool part is I will be re-writing most of the important scripts myself to create easy-to-use templates for hundreds of different in-game features and systems that you can modify freely. All of the templates will be well-documented in the form of comments so even if you are in-experienced with programming you should still be able to change a thing or two.
